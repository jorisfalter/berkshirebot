all right so our friend Logan Yuri she's a behavioral scientist turned dating coach and according to the analytics on
0:06
this podcast 93% of you listeners you're men and a lot of you are young and
0:12
according to the data a lot of you are also single and so we thought it'd be cool to have Logan come on to talk about
0:18
dating and it's shockingly just like building a business and that there's actually a process that you could follow
0:23
you can iterate yourself there and Logan actually broke down how Sean and I met our spouses and gave a bunch of useful
0:30
tips on how to meet someone and it's all backed by science and honestly it's pretty hilarious so check out this
0:36
episode on how to meet your future [Music]
0:44
spouse all right logan is a behavioral scientist i know you Logan as just my good friend but you also had a book
0:50
called How Not to Die Alone and now you're on this tear where you've become a little bit of an expert when it comes
0:55
to dating but also with masculinity i just think you're a great conversationalist and a wonderful person
1:01
and you're really really smart and you have a lot of data to back your a lot of your opinions and you have a Netflix
1:06
show you're the something something high up on the research side at Hinge is that
1:12
right yeah the re director of relationship science but sometimes people just call me the something something yeah you can put that on your
1:19
LinkedIn um Sam I got to tell you a story i I think I've been sitting on
1:25
this story for a little while so I met Logan for the first You know Logan well
1:30
she's your friend i met Logan for the first time at a conference recently she walks up to me i reach out my hand to
1:37
basically shake her hand she goes straight for my face and just
1:43
starts fixing my eyebrows logan doesn't We haven't met she hasn't introduced herself she's just fixing my eyebrows
1:50
for me cuz they're all bushy and crazy and then she's like a like she's like my dad has crazy eyebrows and then I just
1:56
go what and by the way I'm sitting down like a dog i'm sitting at the lunch table so I'm like a pet she's petting me
2:02
and I just thought the confidence that this woman must have she must come on the show because nobody has that
2:09
confidence to do that high high agency isn't that an insane move that's a high agency move one of the craziest things
2:16
anyone's ever done logan explain yourself sean I think I did say "Can I touch your face?" But then you didn't seem that into it and then I was like
2:23
"That was the weirdo thing to do." Well did you feel more into it did you think I was going to be into it sean I did
2:29
make an impression on you you did honestly I never forgot i went home and my daughter since then has just been
2:35
coming up to me and doing it and she's like "You know what I'm doing?" And I "Yeah you're doing the thing that girl did." She goes "Yeah." And this is my
2:41
5-year-old and so she just I'm couldn't be h more happy about this intro well I
2:46
feel Logan I feel like you are incredibly confident but you're also like you in a good way you're like
2:52
conniving i don't know a better word where it's like you see like the end goal and you're like I'm going to
2:58
experiment with this this this and this and I'm just going to follow this process i don't know a better word to describe it calculating you you try
3:05
things and I think you said uh you know you you had a bunch of clients where you would teach them how to date you said
3:10
men were the easiest ones because you would say like "Look you need to lose weight you need to dress better and then
3:15
you need to get a haircut and I need you to then go up and say these five words to this woman and I need you to do that
3:20
50 times." And they would go "Yes ma'am." And then you'd tell a woman the same thing and she'd be like "Well
3:25
you're screwed up too." Or you know what I mean like there was like a difference of uh of like how people would react to
3:30
your instruction well I think that's why I love My First Million and truly am a fan of the show
3:36
like have listened to it for years is that I think the way that the two of you see the world is that it's a game and if
3:42
you know the rules you can win it and I feel like a lot of the show is just teaching people how to play the game and
3:49
that's really the way that I like to think about the world and so many times I'll be like "Okay if Sam was on my
3:55
shoulder like what would he say?" or Sam I'll ask you specifically for your advice on things because I think you sort of just like smile your way through
4:02
life and are like "Yeah I could figure that out." Oh I need to get 30,000 followers on Instagram like duh just do
4:07
some like shirtless cold plunging videos oh wait that's our other friend
4:17
but that's how sub tweet yeah we're talking about Sill Blue but that's how uh that's how uh but that's how you live
4:23
and I think that's that that's interesting i think it's interesting also because we have you know I think like we looked at our analytics the
4:29
other day 93% of our listeners are men and like the majority of them are young men and they look at dating like this
4:36
impossible thing but they look at like engineering or building up businesses as very like systematic and processoriented
4:41
it's kind of the same thing though totally yes and this is why I'm so excited to talk to the MFM audience
4:47
because I really feel like I can help them with dating because the way that I think about it is dating is a skill so
4:52
we're born knowing how to love we have these natural instincts but nobody teaches you how to date and dating is
4:58
actually pretty new in the span of human history so think about how people used to get married so maybe your parcel of
5:04
land touched somebody else's parcel of land so your dads would marry you off so that they would be combined or it was
5:09
about economic institutions but now starting in around 1800s people started
5:15
dating on their own and creating these partnerships and so we don't know how to date we don't know how to pick a partner
5:20
for ourselves and I think a lot of people are failing at it and so that's why I'm here to really help people understand that dating is a skill and
5:27
you can get better at it all right so I've built a few companies that have made a few million dollars a
5:34
year and I've built two companies that have made tens of millions of dollars a year and so I have a little bit of
5:39
experience launching building creating new things and I actually don't come up
5:44
with a lot of original ideas instead what I'm really really good at what my skill set is is researching different
5:51
ideas different gaps in the market and reverse engineering companies and I didn't invent this by the way we had
5:57
this guy Brad Jacobs we talked about him on the podcast he started like four or five different publicly traded companies worth tens of billions of dollars each
6:03
he actually is the one who I learned how to do this from and so with the team at HubSpot we put together all of my
6:09
research tactics frameworks techniques on spotting different opportunities in the market reverse engineering companies
6:15
and figuring out exactly where opportunities are versus just coming up with a random silly idea and throwing it
6:21
against the wall and hoping that it sticks and so if you want to see my framework you can check it out the link
6:26
is below in the YouTube description so give us like I don't know start start with start start with something here so
The secretary problem
6:32
what's the first interesting thing that that you think is less understood or misunderstood great yes i've been
6:39
thinking about your audience really as a lot of maximizers so people who might
6:44
feel like they want to find the perfect partner and so they're going to keep searching and searching until they find
6:50
that person and I too am a maximizer it would take me months to even buy an espresso machine and so that's even
6:56
worse when it comes to people finding a partner but the mistake that a lot of people make especially the MFM Maximizer
7:03
audience is that they search for too long and so what happens is that they think "Okay well I want to find a
7:10
partner who is the hotness of this girl and the ambition of this girl and the family background of this girl and I'm just going to keep searching until I
7:16
find that person." And what they don't understand is that there's diminishing returns over time and so there's this
7:22
concept called the secretary problem have you heard of it yeah I'm using it right now to search for an apartment
7:29
perfect okay so this comes from a line of mathematical inquiry called optimal stop theory which is how long should you
7:35
search and when should you stop so imagine that you're hiring a secretary and there's a 100 candidates you have to
7:41
go through them one at a time after each one you have to say yes or no and you can't go back so at what point should
7:48
you stop so what they say is you should go through the first 37 people and say
7:53
who is the single best candidate of those 37 and that person now becomes your benchmark the next time that you
8:00
find someone as good or better than that person hire them so the idea is you
8:06
don't want to go too long because then all the good people might be in the past but you don't want to go too short because you don't know the pool and so
8:11
37% is approximately the right amount of time so how do you apply that to dating so imagine hypothetically you're going
8:18
to date from ages 18 to 40 what is this 37% mark it's about 26.1 years old and
8:25
so by the time you're 26 you have already met you know a third of the people and you have your benchmark
8:32
person next time you find someone who you like as much or more than them marry that person and this is such important
8:38
advice for people because I think that people have their benchmark and then meet someone they like as much and then say "Well if they're great I can find
8:44
someone even better." and then they get to be 40 41 42 and all their friends are
8:49
on their second or third kid and they're still there trying to you know go to Vegas for the weekend and no one's
8:55
available and so I think that maximizers do really well in a lot of areas of life but when it comes to dating they can
9:01
actually get left behind in their search for perfection i think Sean she was at my house one time recently and like she
9:07
was talking to Sarah and she was like talking about maximizers and then she was like "But Sarah you are a settler or
9:14
something like that." Satisficer satisficer yeah yeah just like you are just okay with like okayness
9:22
i first of all Sam Sam and I are both obsessed with Sarah she is wonderful so
9:28
it's not an insult at all and actually the research shows that between maximizers and satisficers satisficers
9:34
are often happier because it's not that they settle or have a low bar it's that when they find something that meets
9:39
their bar they just buy it or accept it or move in whatever the matter is and so
9:44
maximizers it takes them longer to make a decision and once they make it they question it and satisficers know what
9:50
they want and then when they find it they're happy with it and so I think Sarah really is a happy satisficer
9:56
see this this makes so much sense to me you know when I was when I was younger I started a company with my two best
10:01
friends and on one one hand it was my buddy Trevor and Trevor was like me where now I know the word he's a he was
10:08
a maximizer we would always go try to try new food new restaurant so every time every time we go out to eat we try
10:13
we want to try a new place every time we try a new place we would try to try a new dish at that place and the reality
10:18
is that when you do that you have a lot of unsatisfying lunches right cuz you try a bunch of stuff that you you don't actually like and you're just kind of
10:24
hunting for that the satisfying feeling of once in a while finding something great and our other buddy he would just
10:30
eat Kudoba all the time and Kudoba is like aggressively mediocre and so one
10:36
day he was like "Yeah I'll never try as many foods as you but I'll be happier every day for lunch." And it kind of stuck with me it's like "Oh wow there
10:42
really are two different approaches for life i'm not sure which one's better objectively but there's definitely a better for me and a better for him." You
10:48
know what I mean yeah so research from Adam Grant the Wharton professor finds that satisficers are happier and that
10:54
they make just as good of decisions so you might think especially someone who listens to this podcast no no no but I'm
10:59
going to make the better decision by searching for longer and that's not what the research shows but let me ask you a question okay so the secretary thing
11:05
makes sense to me because hiring a secretary is not like life or death stakes but naring the wrong person
11:10
that's probably one of the the hardest decisions to untangle yourself from and this approach you have
11:17
where you're like you should get to 26.1 years old and then marry the next best person you meet it's cool sounds cool
11:24
like did you do that would does anybody actually do that that sounds insane to I mean I did that i you should show it to
11:31
you what What year did you meet you did it intentionally you might have happened to meet somebody when you were 26 you weren't like "I've gone through 37% of
11:36
the dating pool i have a benchmark all right I'm going to if anybody's better than Rebecca she's it." That wasn't the
11:42
way you thought about it what was your number of 37% though like dude I went on I went on I probably went on I don't
11:48
know 20 terrible dates um you know what I mean like 20 terrible dates two girlfriends on that in that process and
11:55
then when I met my wife I was like "Oh wow she is not just like as good as the
12:00
benchmark." I wasn't even thinking like I was just like "Wow she's amazing." And I just went from I just went to "Oh she's amazing i want to be with her."
12:06
And then that was it it was was like a simple caveman like me like me like this you know that that's how I was thinking
12:12
i wasn't like I wasn't mathematicing my way there so I'll respond to that which is that people definitely get tripped up
12:19
in what you just asked about which is like wait I'm way past 26.1 like have I ruined it it's It sounds very
12:26
mathematical but it's meant to be a metaphor the idea is that you likely have already met someone who would have been a great partner next time you find
12:32
someone who you like as much commit to that person don't keep searching so the 18 to 40 as the equivalent of the
12:39
secretary problem like this is very hypothetical it's like no one knows how long they'll be single for and so the
12:45
point is just that when you've met a bunch of people and you've sort of gotten a sense of your attractiveness in
12:51
the market and what the people are like and where you live then when you find someone great commit to them and I'm
12:56
very happy to talk about this with both of you because both of you are married with kids and there was a version of you
13:02
that could have said "I'm going to wait until I'm peak fitness and peak wealth
13:07
and then find the best possible person I could find at that point." But instead you found people when you were a bit
13:13
younger when you didn't reach the level of success you're at today and that person's been on the journey with you i
13:19
think people really underestimate the opportunity cost of not committing to someone when they're younger because
13:24
when you have this partner that's witnessing your life where you're raising each other where you really know them from a younger age I think there's
13:30
something so precious about that yeah that's definitely true now the thing you just described it's like I have a batch
13:37
of friends in my head i could Yeah I'm not going to name them but I What the batch being what wealthy single guys
13:42
yeah basically the um kind of like they're they're still looking and it's like you found a lot but you're still
13:48
not committing right so they're becoming 36 41 44 and then they're just not
13:54
committing and it's sort of like I don't I think they need to think more like the secretary peter Pans they're Peter Pans
14:00
exactly um a little bit commitment phobic a little bit like maximizer like is there something better out there um
14:07
they might even be in a relationship they're just not they're neither in all the way in nor all the way out okay so I've definitely seen that on the other
14:13
hand there's a group of people who I feel like they might get to 26 and they have not actually gone through 37% of
14:18
the dating pool because they're just not putting up numbers there's they're very low volume interactions with uh you know
14:24
with with the with the other sex i think there's a bunch of studies about this right now how like you know x% of men
14:30
under the age of 30 haven't even asked anyone out like you know or they're just like sort of haven't dated in years or
14:35
things like that so what about that side of the the the barbell the the the problem what's your kind of take or or
14:41
what have you learned for that that group of people yeah that's a great segue if we want to talk about what's happening with modern men which is a
What's happening with men right now
14:48
topic that I'm pursuing and that I'm really passionate about and so it just reminds me Sean of this story where I
14:54
was doing this Valentine's Day thing for Good Morning America and I was talking to the one of the participants and I was
15:01
like you know how many dates you go on this is like a really good-looking guy and he's like "Well at night I think I could either edit videos which will help
15:08
me achieve my career goals for YouTube or I can go on a date that might be bad so I choose editing the videos." And I
15:14
was like "I am terrified about society." Like this guy who should be out there killing it is like "Well my YouTube
15:21
views are more of a sure thing." So anyway I think we have a lot of issues that we need to talk about but what
15:26
we're seeing in the data is that young men are falling behind there's this report from the UK called the Lost Boys
15:33
Report it shows that among men in the UK 16 through 24 one in seven are neat
15:39
which stands for not in education employment or training and this number went up 40% during the pandemic for men
15:45
only 7% for women across all of these metrics enrolling in college graduating from college earning money young men are
15:52
really falling behind so this is an issue for people in this age group and if you project it out to 10 years from
15:58
now it's going to be an even bigger issue because women are into hypergamous
16:04
mating which means that women want to find someone who's equal or higher level
16:09
of status and financial success than them and for most of human history that's worked out well right because the
16:14
guys had the resources and the women married them but now as women are out earning men and being more educated than
16:21
men there just literally isn't this pool of men for them to date and so there's this mating crisis where women are like
16:28
"Where's the guy on my level?" And they just aren't there so right now 60% of
16:33
enrollment in college is women soon it's going to be 2/3 so what that means is that when it's 2/3 women half of those
16:40
women won't have an equivalent guy with a college degree so you really have an issue where women want a certain type of
16:47
guy and that guy doesn't exist and I'm already seeing this so many of my friends are attractive confident
16:53
successful women in their late 30s early 40s they're just not dating there just aren't guys i live in the Bay Area you
17:00
know who's available to them polyamorous guys who are like "Yeah you can have a third of me." And so this woman has to
17:06
say "Do I want zero of a guy or do I want a third of a good guy?" And I truly think that this is part of the reason
17:11
why we're seeing the rise of poly relationships is that there's just not enough great guys and so we have this
17:18
crisis and we're already seeing the impact of it so the marriage rate is nearing an all-time low in the US the
17:25
fertility rate has dropped 20% in 20 years and so truly if fewer people are getting together fewer marriages fewer
17:32
babies this is actually a crisis for humanity did you see how uh do you guys remember uh 64 blue eyes trust fund
17:39
remember that song 65 and someone like inflation what are you doing here and someone like did
17:45
someone like did the math and they were like this is like 20 men in New York
17:50
City like you know if you like do the the analysis of like you need to have a trust fund you need to be single you
17:56
need to be in your 20s you need to be at least 6'5 and you you know whatever work in finance it was like 20 uh people is
18:03
there a thing I think I read somewhere uh I think I talked to my friend Amanda uh who ran the league and then my friend
18:09
Dawoon who had a dating app called OKCid and she was telling me about how on Yeah she had coffee meets bagel sorry uh
18:15
coffee meets bagel and she was telling me how um and I think you told me this at Hinge and you have a lot of this data
18:20
that like it's basically just a few like women all get likes it doesn't matter if you're like a two out of 10 or a 10 out
18:27
of 10 it's like kind of a binary system for men which is like yeah I would uh I would love to go out with you uh for for
18:34
is that what I would means take you on a romantic date yeah like I would love I would love to hang out with
18:40
you uh and for women or for men it was like you know 5% or something like
18:46
dominated it was like a winners take all market what's that data behind that yeah so one stat I can tell you is that a lot
18:52
of women set their height filter at 6 feet or taller and only 14% of the men
18:57
in the US are 6 feet or taller so you have women coming up to me at dinner parties holding up their phone saying
19:02
"I'm on Hinge where's my husband where is he?" And I'm like "Yeah he can't even get into your app because he's 5'9" and
19:08
you're filtering him out it's like your app is a bounce your app is a club and your filters are a bouncer filtering him
19:15
out and so I do think that apps have perpetuated this thing where because you can set filters which maybe you think
19:20
about for 30 seconds you're like yeah 6 feet is good and then you don't even realize the implications of that and
19:25
then when you multiply that across millions of people who are using apps then yes a disproportionate amount of
19:31
attention goes to these guys over six feet and then the other guys are sitting there waiting to hear back from someone
19:37
i used to set my filter to like a really tall woman because I wanted to increase my odds you know like have you ever seen
19:43
Sean a uh Have you ever seen like the back odds of what like making a basketball
19:50
that and meeting someone have you ever seen like the uh the back end of like a woman's app oh you were like I'll go
19:56
fishing over here there's not a lot of people over here yeah like there's not a lot of people who set their default to
20:02
510 for a woman have you ever seen the back like have you ever seen a woman I you know I haven't dated in 10 plus
20:07
years but have you ever seen like Tinder like every person she clicks on is a yes
20:13
oh like when they swipe right it's a match but for guys you're like swipe swipe swipe swipe swipe no match it's basically a match 100% of the time Logan
20:20
isn't it no it totally depends on who the woman is and it also that's not
20:25
exactly how the algorithm works because they don't only show you people who have already said yes to you so it wouldn't
20:30
be like that but I think like certainly for certain women they get so many more people interested in them than they
20:36
could ever go through and then I would swipe yes on literally every Okay Sam we we know that sam we
20:43
know you know hot women we just put your status as like listen if you're seeing me I'm interested yeah and I would get
20:50
no yeses like none yeah yeah dude when I was on a dating app it was brutal but that was like I was like a I was so old
20:57
that like it's back in the day when you had to handw write messages to each person there was no swiping i was on Ok
21:05
so let's play a game if I'm Let's start with I'm a guy on the dating app and then we're going to do I'm a girl on the
How to do the apps right
21:11
dating app what What are the simple things I should be doing differently to
21:17
increase my odds of success and you're the director of relationship science at Hinge so if anyone should know it's you
21:24
great yeah i'm actually gonna answer that by saying like what everyone should be doing and then I have specific like
21:29
guy things okay so let's just talk really quickly about a great profile so your profile is far and beyond the thing
21:35
that matters the most because it's like you were buying a billboard on the 101 in the Bay Area like what are you going
21:41
to put on that expensive billboard so you want to have a really good first photo that clearly shows your face no
21:47
filters no sunglasses and you should invest in a good photo it doesn't have to be a professional photo but people
21:52
want to see what you look like and honestly the quality of male profiles is so low that if you just follow these
21:58
instructions you're going to be better off than 90% of guys are you talking like it's like you're dressed up is it
22:04
casual dog it doesn't have to be dressed up but it's like good lighting um maybe
22:09
have a friend take it in portrait mode it should not be like inside grainy
22:14
anything like that have you ever just asked a friend to take a photo of you with good lighting i've never done that
22:20
in my life so like my pool of pictures dude i'd rather go to the dentist than ask a friend to take a picture of me
22:27
that's so funny so okay at some point your mom takes a good picture of you and you upload it then you want one picture
22:34
of you with your friends because we need to see that you have a social life it could be friends or family do you know
22:40
this meme from a long time ago of like 10 white guys at a baseball game and each of them is like popping their head
22:46
out a little bit more it's like you don't want a photo where you all look the same but we should be able to see like this is what your life is like then
22:52
one of you doing an activity that you like maybe you're into hiking cooking i know this probably seems so awkward for
22:58
guys like how am I going to get these photos but it really does matter i heard this story about when this woman saw
23:05
this guy's app profile and it was like all Burning Man pictures and she's like I'm not into Bernie man at all and then
23:11
she swiped left and then a few years later she met him and she really liked him and now they're married and when
23:17
they talked about it he's like oh yeah I only went to Bernie man once I didn't like it but those were the only photos I had right so he didn't realize like that
23:23
it was really setting him back do you guys do you guys do just pop up like hey guys listen we
23:31
know we know you got nothing okay just come come here on Saturday morning you're going to get your picture for hinge like do you guys do that like do
23:37
is there a thing like at the next my first million event you should have a photographer there who's taking app
23:43
profiles
23:49
photog like what's the ratio of photos that you have of you and your children versus your wife and your children
23:56
because I know at my house Sarah is always the one taking the pictures and I would not in a million years pull out my
24:01
phone and be like here let me capture this for you yeah well she asks like all the time for me like hey take this
24:06
picture and I'm like oh god it's so funny that's like my main feedback for my husband you don't take enough pictures of me with my daughter it's so
24:12
funny sarah's like "I have no photos of me and our baby like can you please start taking more photos?" Yes seriously
24:19
just don't do it so you're saying profile matters the most get a good get uh get your hero shot which is you you
24:25
can see your face good lighting great activity picture great you and your friends but not you and five identical
24:31
friends like you got to have some some uh diversity here some get some get you want to stand out in that picture are we
24:36
talking you know what's that theory where it's like you know you want to be the hottest out of your group or something like you know like are you
24:42
like conniving like that can we go Mchavelian and just There is a funny theory in behavioral science which is
24:48
that people don't make decisions in a vacuum they make decisions through comparison so if you have a friend who
24:53
looks like you but is slightly less attractive then that'll make you look even more attractive but I wouldn't say
24:58
I've tried that in the wild but there is some uh data to back that up all right it's a call we had an ugly friend we We
25:05
even told him we were like "You're the ugly friend dude you just got to go." It was like "Dude either I'm at the bottom or I'm going to the middle." And guess
25:10
what chaos is a ladder baby you're going to the bottom i'm in the middle now
25:16
and then on Hinch there's these prompts that you fill out which are ice breakers and I really feel like this is a chance for a lot of guys to shine because so
25:23
many of the profiles I look at are just pretty weak here so you want to have a mixture of humor and vulnerability so
25:28
you can be funny you can be sarcastic you can give your hot takes but then also have some where you show that you
25:33
also have a heart and you're not just silly and Hinge Now has this AI profile
25:38
feedback tool which will say something like go deeper or say a little bit more and so you can just really think about
25:44
what are the three things that I want to get across on my profile maybe the fact that you're family oriented that you
25:51
love the Warriors and that you're really into cooking well make sure through your profile pictures and your prompts that
25:56
you're getting that across what else can a guy do to stand out on these yeah so
26:01
then the next thing is that especially for people who aren't getting a lot of matches besides your profile which is the number one thing you should send
26:08
comments with your likes because it really helps you stand out so if you're a guy who's like I'm just not getting that many matches i'm just going to go
26:14
for quantity and I'm just going to send a bunch of likes well it's much better to send a thoughtful comment with that
26:20
because you're more likely to stand out another insider tip that I've heard is that guys are often lazy and they only
26:27
comment on like the first picture or the first prompt on a girl's profile so if you actually scroll down and you comment
26:33
on something lower you have a higher chance of being more original because fewer people have just ever commented on
26:40
that and how do you comment without being uh just like totally thirsty or just lame so what's a what's a good
26:45
comment versus bad comment there okay so there's this line from Chris Rock which is if a girl's name is Eve don't walk up
26:51
to her and say "Hi I'm Adam." She's heard that a million times so in standup comedy you might think like the best
26:56
joke is like the third punch line you come up with cuz the first or second other people can come up with it so if a
27:01
person has a picture of themselves skiing and says "Where was this taken?" Don't say "I think it's Whistler." It's like cool you and everyone else but like
27:08
if you can write back something witty about like okay I'm going to challenge you to a black diamond or whatever
27:14
people who ski say then it's a much better way of getting into a conversation and so really you're trying
27:21
to show your value here you're trying to show your level of wit and humor and you don't have to overthink it but just what
27:27
is a way to get into a conversation with someone especially something that not every other guy has already said it
Meeting someone IRL
27:32
seems so much easier if I look at the math of you saying like what was the stat how many women have been approached
27:38
in real life or how many men approach uh was it like most most men zero yeah in
27:44
real life so then wouldn't it be just so much like I met my wife in a real life
27:50
setting it just and even back then when this was less common but still common it just seems so much easier to meet people
27:57
by just kind of pretending that you're confident and like even just say like like you just saying hi to them like it
28:02
just it was so much easier that way can we just Shouldn't we just teach guys to do that i think this is a big issue in
28:09
modern dating is almost everyone I talk to is like I want to meet someone the oldfashioned way i'm romantic i don't
28:14
want to meet someone on the app but then if you ask them if they're meeting people in real life they basically say no and last summer there was like the
28:20
run clubs everyone's meeting at run clubs like I haven't met a single couple that met through the run club so I think
28:26
we're having this issue with Gen Z where they don't necessarily want to be on apps they want to be meeting people in
28:31
real life but they don't have the social skills to do it and so there's this huge problem with the younger dator that I
28:37
talked to where they lack rejection resilience so you know this goes down a whole pathway of parenting but you know
28:44
they had these helicopter parents they had these snowplow parents that kind of plowed the way for them and they never
28:49
had to deal with issues they had colleges that bended to every will and if their dog had an ear infection they didn't have to turn in a paper you have
28:56
these um workplaces where they can take a sick day you know for any random
29:01
reason and then you want that person to go up to someone at a coffee shop be able to deal with rejection like they don't have the skills to do that and so
29:08
yes if everyone listening to this got really good at approaching women and making them feel both comfortable and
29:14
flattered and had a good opening line like bring on the babies that would be great but people are lacking the social
29:19
skills right now to do that and I think in a postme too era there is this fine
29:25
line between confident and creepy that people have not figured out yet how did you meet your wife Sean in real life or
29:32
app yeah in real life but she was uh she was like best friends growing up with my cousin and so through like a kind of
29:38
like I was there to do something for my cousin she was there to do something for my cousin we kind of bumped into each other that way and then I was like uh
29:46
that was a much easier thing cuz I didn't have to like approach with a pickup line and it's like I had like an hour where we're hanging out and I just
29:51
had to try to make her laugh like so all right if I get this girl to laugh three times in this hour this is going to be you know that's pretty good all right
29:57
that that's my goal and so I was just trying to be as entertaining and you know fun as possible for an hour so
The power of weak ties
30:03
there's this concept called the power of weak ties which is the idea that you're much more likely to get a job from an
30:09
acquaintance than from one of your close friends because your close friends have such overlapping lives with you that they know the same opportunities you
30:16
know but an acquaintance who you met at a wedding a few years ago and still are Instagram friends with they might know
30:22
something that you don't know and the same thing is true with dating so Sam you didn't meet or Sean you didn't meet
30:28
your wife through you know your siblings best friend it you know it was your cousin and so one thing that people
30:34
listening to this can do is can they can expand their network so leave your house go out make new friends meet people
30:41
volunteer join the boards of things the more friends and acquaintances and wider the network is the more chance that you
30:46
will have a weak tie who will eventually introduce you to your spouse and one of the reasons I was so excited for this
30:52
conversation is that I love teaching people the strategies that Sam did to
30:57
meet Sarah which I can happily summarize or Sam if you want to summarize we can do that too i think you should do it i I
31:03
want to hear your take on this okay this is my like Sam super fandom but one thing that Sam did that I really like
31:09
because I think it shows vulnerability but it also is very masculine is that Sam's like "How can I be the most
31:16
attractive mate possible i'm going to make myself more interesting." And so Sam really planted a lot of seeds and
31:22
really worked on being more interesting so he was like "Wow like when I talk about my interest in denim and that I'm going to a denim meet then women seem to
31:29
be into that." So he was genuinely passionate about it but he also knew to talk about it he was also like "Well I'm
31:34
not making that much money right now but I want to show that I have a growth mindset and that you know I'm very
31:40
ambitious and like you know potentially I'll be successful long term." Sam also likes to test out his stories well how
31:46
do I know what the best story is how do I know what the funniest story is i'm going to practice it over time and get better at it and so I think that if
31:53
somebody is a super fan of both of you they might think "Oh these guys are just so smooth i bet it was so easy for
31:59
them." But you were intentional Sam about being the best possible most attractive mate and then you snagged a
32:05
baddie well I I want to say first of all I have three things to say the first one is thank you the second one is that I
32:12
realized that effort goes a long way and that the best way to be attractive to a woman is to work on myself and bring
32:18
them along with my life which hopefully is full of interesting things and even if it's like something as nerdy as as
32:24
denim the best thing about being a man when it comes to attracting a woman is if you're passionate about anything it doesn't matter how lame it is that's
32:31
kind of attractive and the third thing is is that you have to also if you're going to say all these positive things
32:36
you have to say the line that I use to meet her so no I don't want to bring it up so you're you're acting like I'm like
32:43
Quick cut to a HubSpot commercial okay so Sean do you know what this line is i know this line i can't believe he's
32:49
voluntarily saying this right now me neither i thought we were going to skip over this no I don't mind saying it and so basically my wife Sarah she walked
32:56
into the and we we were at like a happy hour she walked in i was with my friend Lily i go "Lily that woman she looks
33:02
fantastic i'm not leaving until she uh talks to me." And as I was saying that she comes up to me and I didn't know
33:08
what to say in time and so I said "Excuse me what's the difference between a chickpea and a lentil?" And she looks
33:15
at her friend and she's like "I don't know." And I was like "I don't pay $500 to have a lentil on my face." And for
33:20
those today I'm talking about a chickpea on my face and uh and she like gasped and I was like "Classic hummus joke am I
33:27
right?" And uh hi I'm Sam nice to meet you and it it absolutely helps oh my god
33:34
we need a warning label that says do not try this at home yeah just say just say hit the skip button and move forward 30
33:40
seconds if you just never want to change the way you look at Sam again sam why did you say that by the way had you said
33:46
that before why would that be the first thing to come to mind i don't remember reading that in the game what an absurd
33:51
line i don't I don't know it just came to me like where did you read that where did that even come from i don't remember
33:58
how a friend like told me that joke i don't remember but I thought it would have worked but here's another thing he's a homosexual yeah I'm a Yeah I'm a
34:06
freak i had just finished a cross-country motorcycle trip literally the day before and I had all these
34:12
pictures this was in 2014 i had all these pictures on Facebook of my cross country motorcycle trip and so instead
34:18
of asking for her phone number I was like "Here let me friend you on Facebook and we'll talk there." And I like So I
34:24
like frontloaded like my photos with all these like where I looked cool and so that also helped uh but so I did try all
34:32
those things that you said were true and also I'm still a filthy filthy animal and I say things like I said and and it
34:37
also worked let me give the postgame analysis of that so I wouldn't recommend that line cuz I think it could definitely be misinterpreted but at
34:44
least you had the guts to say something misinterpreted i I think it'd be interpreted perfectly
34:50
it's true i mean Sarah knew what she was signing up for i feel like you're consistent but I think so this is feels
34:56
like a very of the- moment thing which is that if you just sit at home waiting for the perfect line then you'll never
35:02
approach someone sam did not have the perfect line but he just said something and it made an impression and I feel
35:08
like what you said about effort is exactly right and so in a lot of the research I've been doing this year about
35:13
how men and women are becoming increasingly polarized right so women are way more liberal than men right now
35:20
in how they voted people used to vote across racial lines and now they're actually voting across gender lines for
35:26
the first time in history men in the US are more religious they're more likely to go to church than women and we're
35:33
just seeing that men and women are really being polarized so how do we actually get people to connect and
35:38
create these couples have babies etc so one thing through my research is that men think oh women expect me to be
35:44
perfect i have to be tall financially successful all these things what the women are saying is like "We just want
35:49
you to put some effort in just remember my coffee order know the name of my best friend at work." And I feel like effort
35:55
is just underappreciated and as I said if you have a good profile that's a seven out of 10 you're still way ahead
36:02
of a lot of the guys out there and so I think when it comes to the basic things that men can do here's a list of a few
36:09
of them so a lot of women say to me "I go on dates that are ZQ zero questions."
36:15
They asked the guy tons of questions and the guys didn't ask them a single question and then when I talk to guys
36:21
hey how did this happen they say well she asked me a question if she wanted to answer it she should have just answered
36:26
it already and I was like no ask her the question back make her feel interesting i think that's a huge tip make people
36:33
feel interesting have you guys seen Love on the Spectrum all the autistic kids they all say the same thing at first and
36:39
it's the greatest line ever I guess like they're taught in a dating school or something and they say "So what are your interests?" And they all say that and
36:46
it's the best line ever and it just it's just such a good interest or it's just such a good line i'm obsessed with love
36:51
on the spectrum so what are your interests like if I said that to someone or someone said that to me I'd be like how much time you got i can I can go all
How to be a better date
36:57
day so I think this goes back to like the
37:02
Dale Carnegie stuff but be interested not interesting people think I have to have the best stories i have to have the
37:08
Facebook photos of my motorcycle trip no you know what people actually want to do they want to talk about themselves ask
37:13
them questions seem very interested in them and that will make the other person like you there's all this research that
37:19
in conversations where one person is talking a lot and the other person is asking questions the first person thinks
37:24
"Wow that other person's a great conversationalist." And what that actually means is they made me feel interesting and important and so I think
37:31
that there's so much that men can do just by asking questions asking follow-up questions seeming really
37:36
interested in somebody and remembering stuff if a girl says on a date "I have a big project that's due on Tuesday," then
37:43
text her Monday night or Tuesday morning and say "How did that go?" These little things go so far yeah i think what I'm
37:49
hearing is you know in this podcast we talk about certain businesses where you go into a space and it's just like
37:55
there's like a sleepy incumbent you know that maybe everybody in that space is still operating on pen and paper they don't do any marketing and it just feels
38:02
like oh man you're shooting fish in a barrel like if you just go and you just try you just do the basics you will
38:07
clean up in that area it basically sounds that like dating is like this i think in most most of my single friends
38:12
the way they talk about dating is almost like it's this impossible game but hey I'm still putting up I'm still fighting
38:18
the good fight and then I hear what you're talking about I'm like "Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah." Actually nobody tries
38:24
in a way that matters so like you know my same friends who are you talking about it like it's an impossible game if
38:30
I bet if I ask them I'm like "Hey when's the last time you updated your profile?" Like "Let me just see your profile real quick how much effort did you put into
38:37
this?" And it's like "Yo you know this is the this is your landing page this is what everybody is seeing this is how
38:42
they're making their decisions." And you put 14 minutes of work into it when you were signing up just speeding through to
38:47
get on the app and then you never really touched it again well that's the problem right like you're just not investing the
38:53
effort in the simple things that are going to make a difference and everything you said like even if you just throw out any of the specifics like
38:59
it's not about the good lighting or it's not about the photo with the friends and whatever it's literally like try on the
39:05
things that matter sounds like uh you know the biggest takeaway and that most people are either not trying or they're
39:10
trying on the things that don't matter they're trying in things that like they're spending a lot of time swiping but that's not the thing that's going to
39:16
help you uh actually find somebody yes Sean I love your ability to really
39:21
summarize and bring out the most important points and I think try on the things that matter is an incredible headline for this because yes if you are
39:27
taller will you have an advantage on the app 100% that is a bias that is baked into these filters but if you just give
39:33
up because you're not over 6 feet tall then that's a choice that you're making why not have a better profile why not
39:40
have a friend take pictures of you even if it's you know more embarrassing or painful than going to the dentist why
39:45
not send comments with likes if you really are serious about finding someone then there are just basic things that
39:50
you can do that will set you ahead of most other men right and you only need one which is my favorite thing about a
39:56
lot of the best things in life like you know business success i failed for nine years and then I had one and all of a
40:01
sudden I was a millionaire it's like oh you I only needed one like I didn't need all of these to work i needed one to work same thing with dating you only
40:06
need one to work uh really to make it work but it definitely it definitely helps to put up numbers though I think like I I like I remember dating and I
40:13
was like when it rains it pours like I remember when I was able to get one person interested in me I would be more confident and then I go after more and
40:20
more and more and I was like "Oh I'm killing it." And I'm like "Why did I do this earlier and but it's hard to getting over that first one is really
40:26
hard." Like the rejection you also knew where to stop because there's a version where you were like "If I can get Sarah
40:31
who else can I can get?" And instead you were like "I could get Sarah." Like hell yeah this is my wife logan you have this
Date like a scientist
40:38
thing called date like a scientist what does that mean yes i definitely think that this is sort of the my first
40:43
million approach to dating so date like a scientist just means be willing to run experiments and see what works so if the
40:50
business equivalent is throwing up a landing page or running some Google ads then that's what this is in dating so
40:56
let's say that I'm coaching a guy and he says "Okay well I need a woman who has a
41:02
graduate degree." Then I'll say "Okay date like a scientist date someone without graduate degrees." Maybe what
41:08
you're actually looking for is someone who's intellectually curious and you're using a graduate degree as a proxy for that let's just have you date other
41:14
types of people and see what happens i do this for women around dating guys who have a different job than they expected
41:20
or shorter than they expected and so the whole point is that as we get older we get clearer and clearer on what we think
41:26
we want in a relationship and I have people that walk into my office and say "Here's a spreadsheet of all the women
41:32
I've dated over the last 10 years and I know exactly what I want i want a 5'7 skinny red head who's Jewish and plays
41:38
tennis and I'm like I think you're wrong i think that's what you think you want but let's actually test and see who
41:44
actually makes you happy long term and so date like a scientist is being willing to run experiments being proven
41:51
right or wrong and actually get clearer on who's going to make you happy long term instead of assuming that you know
41:57
is there any signs of like I always a a lot of my friends are Indian and their parents had arranged marriages and many
42:04
of them are just lovely uh couples and they're very happy and I've always thought life's a lot better when you
42:11
have less choice and so the way that I went into marriage it was like this is forever there is no such thing as like
42:17
divorce like you know cuz I'm like Irish Catholic background and that's just like what you're taught and for some reason I
42:23
think that you're happier that way where you're like if I'm miserable it's just like yeah that's fine i'm going to be miserable and hopefully I'll make it
42:29
better versus like well I wonder are there other options uh there's something
42:34
about finality or like no other choice that I think makes me happier is there
42:40
anything yeah there is a lot of research on that so when you compare love marriages versus arranged marriages love
42:47
marriages usually start off happier but around the 5year mark arranged marriages
42:52
are happier and it's exactly what you said Sam it's the fact that you're committed and you're in it and you don't
42:57
consider failure as an option okay so my husband's working too much and I feel stressed out and I miss him i'm gonna
43:04
commit to working out this thing with him versus giving up and there are nuances to the data and it depends on
43:10
whether or not the culture allows for divorce and things like that but I think the point is that when you think about
43:15
things as temporary you just don't commit to them as much so I was at oh actually that dialogue conference and
43:21
this guy was like I think that um marriages should be like cell phone contracts and every seven years you
43:28
decide to recommit or not and there should be a conversation and I was like that's a cute thing to say but that's not what the research supports because
43:34
if you have an apartment versus owning a home are you going to put wallpaper on the wall are you going to get a new
43:41
dishwasher no you're going to be like "This is temporary i have one foot out the door." But when you own your home and when you're really committed you
43:47
invest a lot in it because you think about it as a forever investment and so when you really think about I'm
43:53
committed I'm in this i'm going to do whatever it takes to work then that really produces better long-term results
43:59
i'm on this Warren Buffett kick cuz he just retired and so I'm rereading a bunch of Warren Buffett books and he's got this thing where he tells his
44:06
managers as well as to uh as any uh aspiring entrepreneurs they ask him "How do I build a great company?" because
44:12
Birkshshire Hathway is famous for buying great companies and he said um three things I need you to act like this
44:18
business is the only business that you own you are not allowed to have any other business the second thing you need
44:25
to act and assume that your entire net worth is in this business and number
44:30
three assume that you can't sell this business for at least the next 50 years
44:35
and if you do that I think you'll make better decisions and it's kind of funny how what you're saying for dating and
44:41
what Warren says for business and what I think a lot of us know for business it's a lot of the similar things i want to
44:47
add one thing to that which is that I was at a Jewish Indian wedding this past weekend and it was really beautiful and
44:53
especially my friend who's Indian her parents live in Atlanta and they didn't have any other family there but they
44:59
have built this beautiful this beautiful community around them called potluck and you can just see the power of the
45:04
community so during the site so many people from the potluck community were dancing and the children of potluck are
45:10
all friends and I think people underestimate how important it is to have a community around you because we
45:16
are not meant to just be married and just have this one person that fulfills all of our goals and every aspect of our
45:23
lives we need a community to support us to talk [ __ ] about our partner with to help us when one person is sick to help
45:29
us with child care and so I think just watching this beautiful Indian community who really showed up for this wedding
45:35
and really helped shape the bride into who she is it really inspired me to invest even more in my community
45:43
what are you going to say Sean well I was going to ask about like all right so I'm just thinking about my friends who are single and I'm trying to think if I
Fuck the spark
45:50
was going to send them this episode how would I make it what question would I ask to make it most valuable for them
45:55
all right so here's two scenarios scenario one uh go on a date it was good
46:00
but it wasn't like "Wow I met the one that was my soulmate." Right you don't have that level of absolute clarity and
46:07
conviction so what is the post date psychology so I went on a date how
46:12
should I be thinking post date in order to you know I want to have I want to give things a chance but I also don't
46:18
want to string things along if I'm settling for something that's not really what I want don't you have a thing on that Logan about Yeah yeah that is kind
46:24
of my tagline go ahead yeah so Sean I have this sort of tagline called [ __ ] the spark which is this idea that
46:30
through doing 10 years of coaching I'll talk to a guy I'll help him with the date he'll come over my house afterwards
46:36
i'll say how was it he'll say she was great she was beautiful it was fun i'm never going to see her again i'm like
46:42
are you crazy what are you talking about and he's like I just didn't feel the spark and so the spark has become my
46:47
nemesis where people expect to show up and feel this romcom moment of butterflies and rainbows and they will
46:54
give up if they don't feel that and so I've developed these three myths of the spark so the first one is the myth is if
47:01
I don't feel it from the beginning it can't grow and that's absolutely not true only 11% of people experience love
47:06
at first sight and many people develop feelings over time which is why people marry someone in their apartment building marry someone at work it grows
47:13
over time second myth is if you feel the spark it's a good thing that's also not always true some people are just really
47:18
sparky they give that feeling to everyone and then you're like "Oh my god there's something special between me and that person." And it's like "No honey he
47:24
gives that feeling to everyone he's very sparky and he could also be narcissistic and that's why it's happening." And then
47:30
the third one is if you have a spark then the relationship is viable that's also not true you can start really hot
47:36
and heavy and then it fades over time so my antidote to that is the slow burn and
47:41
I feel like I married the slow burn and Sam can attest to that where I don't think my husband is the most charming person you'll ever meet but he's really
47:48
smart he's really funny but he takes time to warm up and so I feel like by
47:54
giving him more time I found this amazing lottery pick and I feel like I
47:59
won the lottery but if I had just been looking for the sparkiest person we wouldn't have wound up together and so I
48:05
think if you feel zero attraction especially for men don't go on the second date it's not going to go from zero to something but if you feel some
48:12
attraction then give that person another chance especially if you don't go on that many dates
48:18
and if you were Okay so like sometimes when you study a subject a lot or you
48:23
try to help a lot of people to that individual person their problem feels very unique very special very hard but
48:29
like you've seen a hundred of these and maybe even to the hundred you could say you're like oh man I I feel like I could
48:35
help you so much I don't have all the time in the world but there's almost this like if I could just shake you and get you to like either do one thing or
48:42
understand one thing or take on one mindset what's the one that if you could just like shake people be like all right
48:48
that's like they got that and then that will have all these positive benefits i don't know if it's different for men and women you know that you that you run
48:55
into but like what's the advice you just want to shake somebody and just be like if you just really internalize this or did this action it would really change
49:01
your game we talked about [ __ ] the spark we talked about date like a scientist so the last one left for this is my concept
What's your tendency
49:07
called the three dating tendencies and people can take the quiz on my website and it tells you which tendency you are
49:14
and this really helps people have language for what's going on with them and so I I just took it by the way do you want to you want me to tell you my
49:20
results i assume that you're a maximizer i scored equally high on hesitator and
49:25
maximizer tendencies that's so funny okay let me explain what all of those are well I mean it's obviously kind of
49:30
like I'm not dating so like I just kind of had I tried to put myself in the mindset of like you know 24year-old me
49:36
and um it says who you are as a hesitator you don't think you're ready for dating because you're not the person you want to be yet you hold yourself to
49:42
a high standard you want to be completely ready before you start a new project and the same goes for dating um your motto as a hesitator i'll wait till
49:48
I'm a catch and who you are as a and then maximizer is you love doing research exploring your options turning
49:54
over every stone until you're confident you found the right one you make decisions carefully and you want to be 100% certain before you make your choice
49:59
your motto as a maximizer is why settle and then it gives you like advice on how to um like how to kind of operate
50:07
knowing that that's your tendencies right and the last one is the romanticizer which men do tend to score
50:14
lower on this but basically someone who's obsessed with the we met story i want to find my soulmate i'll know it
50:19
when I see it and they're so focused on kind of the romcom element that they
50:26
ignore a lot of great potential partners or when they actually hit a bump in the road instead of thinking I'll have a work it out mindset and I'll work
50:32
through it they actually think well if it was my soulmate then we wouldn't have issues and they end the relationship and
50:38
I think having this language is very helpful for people because I get emails from men all the time that are like "I'm a hesitator i'm not putting myself out
50:44
there." And I'm like "Great you just need to go from zero to one you just need to be on dates." And for Maximizer my advice is what I said at the
50:50
beginning of the episode which is understand that you can keep searching forever to find the perfect person but
50:56
you'll miss out on choosing someone great and building something together what's going to happen in like 10 years
AI partners
51:02
15 years 20 years with a lot of the kids who are 25 right now and 20 years old
51:08
the fact like it's pretty crazy that you're saying I mean we already know this that most women want someone who's above them or like who provides but
51:15
amongst like my company and I don't know about you Sean the women are kicking the dude's asses like if you take like a man
51:22
and a woman who are both 25 the 25-year-old woman is a better employee like she's typically like like for
51:28
example we went to a we had an event the other day and like the women dressed wonderfully like they look presentable
51:34
and the men I had to pull aside and be like dude you got to like dress nicer at these things and at least tuck your
51:39
t-shirt in uh and like the men typically ask for more money but are less good at
51:44
their job the men tend to be sloppier they tend to like think it's cool not to
51:50
care uh there's like a there's like a bunch of issues that I've noticed themes and this is a small sample size of
51:55
dozens of employees and but what's going to happen in like 20 years is it just going to be a bunch of single people and
52:01
less children or is it just going to be a bunch of women who are married to old men who are richer than the I don't know
52:07
what is what is it going to be yeah so first of all I drew my research through talking to people now and seeing
52:13
patterns or recognizing that I think predictions are pretty hard but I will throw some some things at the wall and
52:20
see if any of the like end up being true so one of them is that I do think that
52:25
we are going to continue to have this mating gap where as you say women continue to thrive in terms of education
52:31
and employment and then there just aren't enough great guys for them and I'm seeing at least among my friends the
52:37
rise of single mother by choice where women hit 40 and they're like I didn't find the guy I still want to be a mom
52:43
and they use a sperm donor or a known a known donor and they actually have kids on their own another thing is the rise
52:49
of polyamory and a lot of these relationships where you know as I said
52:54
the woman is willing to have like less of a great guy than you know a guy that she's not interested in another thing
53:01
that we haven't talked about yet is just the rise of AI and AI companionship so
53:07
I'm getting ads all the time from Replica you know get your perfect AI boyfriend he always says the right
53:12
things women love this by the way i think more than men i think women are liking AI boyfriends more than men are
53:18
liking AI girlfriends i I did not think it was going to be that way but I I know so many women who like I feel like they are in love with their chat GPT i
53:25
haven't seen the research on that yet my hunch would just be that men are more early adopters here and like more
53:30
desperate but it could be the case replica it is more of the AI boyfriend use case than AI girlfriend that's very
53:36
interesting well there you go on like VC Twitter it was always like oh AI girlfriend's going to be huge but
53:41
actually AI Boyfriend has been the the dominant use case uh so far so imagine
53:46
that you have some combination of AI glasses with really HD pornography you
53:53
have this sex robot that's very realistic and you have companionship from your AI boyfriend or girlfriend
54:00
like why are you gonna go up to somebody in a coffee shop and risk rejection why are you going to have a girlfriend who
54:07
bugs you to pick up your socks when this person is this chatbot is sick of tells
54:12
you how great you are all the time and so I think as the friction gets lower and lower and lower to having a digital
54:18
spouse or partner then the effort that's required for human relationships just feels extra hard and like that is a
54:25
thing that I'm worried about because if you don't have the motivation if you're just watching Twitch and watch other
54:30
people live their lives and like are people just going to slowly die off because we're not actually dating and
54:36
mating yeah that's so that's your prediction i I think that's just one of them i think other things are that women
54:43
are going to have to change their expectations and men are going to have to raise the bar on themselves so women right now are saying I'm going to earn
54:50
as much or more than you i also have to do a lot of the labor around having a
54:56
kid raising a kid i have this double burden of domestic and work and so no longer is a guy being a provider enough
55:03
and that's what it was for a long time so you now need to be emotionally intelligent so emotional intelligence is
55:09
the new currency in dating but guys were not raised to do that they were not told how to be emotionally intelligent they
55:14
were basically told from a young age be successful be a provider make money and now the game has changed and they're
55:20
caught without those skills plus we have the other side of it is that when they are vulnerable women are like "Oh no you
55:27
seem weak i'm turned off by that." So I think that the genders are overlapping more where women have to be more
55:33
masculine in the workplace men have to be more feminine in relationships and some of that blurring is making dating
55:39
worse and it's making relationships more confusing and I think that the dating
55:44
hasn't caught up with the data that people just do not know how to act in this modern world and we need I don't
55:51
know the answer but we need to figure out some changes to it so that people actually still want to be in partnership
55:56
i am so thankful that I don't have to deal with this [ __ ] oh my god bring me back to the 60s where I worked with
56:02
asbestous and I had a high you know the average lifespan was 66 years old and I smoked a pack of sigs a day because this
56:07
sounds really hard you remember when there was that like huge tsunami in like Southeast Asia i
56:15
don't know if you know this Sam I was there the day before it hit and we happened to leave and then the next day we turned on the TV and our hotel was
56:21
floating in the ocean i feel a little bit like that i'm like "Wow we got out of there." You know I'm really glad I
56:27
got out of there cuz all these shifts are sort of headwinds none of the none of the things you described is a tailwind that's making it easier um but
56:34
you know easy might not might not be the the only criteria here because the way you're describing dating is that dating
56:39
is a skill and um it's it's an endeavor just like any of your other endeavors it's going to take some effort it's
56:45
going to take some rejection it's going to take some resilience and it's going to take you leveling up your skill if you want to be successful at it right
56:51
just like in business you can't just go into business and be like "Cool I will face no no no obstacles no rejections i
56:58
will not get knocked down and my skills from day one are good enough for me to win like that's just not how it goes so
57:04
if I wanted to level up my skills and it sounds like you've you've mentioned a couple of them you talked about like
57:09
emotional intelligence you talked about conversationalists like how to have how to be interesting interested how to ask
57:14
questions properly like if I just committed after listening to this and I was like "All right I'm going to go level up in those." Is there like a
Pro tip: join a mens group
57:20
killer book that you would recommend or like a way to actually develop that skill like what what would be the
57:25
fasttrack way to develop some of these skills besides the obvious which is get practice yeah so we talked about the
57:31
idea of effort and that effort goes a long way and remember things follow up with things women really love that
57:37
develop your relational skills so one thing that I'm really passionate about is men's groups and I'm very curious to
57:44
hear what you both think about this and as I was preparing for this episode I was like "Oh I kind of feel like maybe they'll feel like it's cringey." But I
57:51
just feel like men's groups are so powerful so a year ago my husband joined one our good friend David Clavven
57:57
started it and it's about six men they meet once a month they go around and they each silently write down on some
58:03
post-it notes what's top of mind for them then they go around and whoever has kind of the things that are most present
58:09
for them and really wants to take up space they let those people talk they give them feedback and it's really a
58:15
great place for men to be angry for men to be sad for men to create this council of peers and then they hold each other
58:22
accountable and I've seen so much growth in my husband so much growth in the other guys in this group and I think
58:28
it's better than therapy because most therapists are female so having your wife or having your female therapists
58:34
tell you what to do I think that's fine but having a council of peers who can really relate to you and create a safe space for you to be angry and sad I
58:41
think that that's creating a lot more growth and I really hope that at least one person listening to this decides to
58:47
create a men's group and it's not that complicated find a few guys who you respect commit to meeting once a month
58:53
create a space where they feel safe to discuss what's challenging for them and then just support each other in achieving those goals yeah that's great
59:00
um have you ever done one Sam not like business related like have you ever done one that's like a actual men's group
59:06
i've done a few yeah look like the one that you and I did or you led it that was basically this uh because we were
59:12
all early in our relationships at the time and like we were asking each other questions but uh yeah I have and I I I
59:18
like to make fun of it but the reality is it's super useful and awesome and like making fun of it like normalizes it
59:23
and like makes it cool yeah yeah i've done I've done uh I've done it a few times and it's it's actually like the
59:30
way you described it just now is kind of perfect like it's much much better i haven't done therapy i've done uh like
59:36
coaching but like you know we can tell yeah yeah i could I could imagine how someone who needs that sort of thing
59:43
would would feel um but you know in therapy it's an intense focus on self i think one of the best things about these
59:48
men's groups is actually it's not about you and um because it's a group you get a lot out of it even when you weren't
59:55
the one talking you weren't the one sharing cuz like there's so much that's either related or just taking the focus
1:00:01
off your own problems of helping somebody out with their problems all of a sudden you feel lighter and you're like I don't even I didn't even do anything i didn't even change my own
1:00:07
situation but I feel better and so I think that's a a great um a great idea okay so men's groups is one way to get
1:00:13
better one more thing about that is that I I don't think there's that many places for men to talk about shame and I think
1:00:19
in general shame is just a very challenging feeling and I heard this what's an example of a shame thing this
1:00:24
was a story and someone in a different men's group told me where it was like they had been fired from their job like
1:00:29
eight years ago and they still carried this deep shame i'm not good enough i'm useless i was fired because I'm a bad
1:00:35
employee and their men's group happens to have this guy's 40 people in this men's group are 55 and when he shared
1:00:41
that story as this deep trauma of his life he heard from a bunch of other guys oh yeah that happened to me that's going
1:00:47
to be a footnote in your life i just thought it was such a beautiful story because it took this thing that he felt deeply shameful about i can't provide
1:00:54
for my family i'm a problem even though it was years ago and he has a perfectly good job now and having these older guys
1:01:00
say to him that happens to everyone it doesn't matter kind of helps him just move on and so I think it's a thing
1:01:05
where you can talk about the stuff that you sort of only admit to yourself or maybe don't even admit to yourself and
1:01:11
once you get it out there it kind of goes away versus holding it in and I think most men are just holding
1:01:17
everything in is there anything someone can go read or watch or listen to right now is there anything easier you could
1:01:23
do besides like being vulnerable and sharing and meeting people can I like push a button and get this result you
1:01:28
need you need like a gateway drug you know like starting a men's group is not exactly the gateway drug you know for
1:01:34
like people of our generation sean and I probably both did the same thing we read the book The Game which like has has so
1:01:40
many flaws in it but the one thing that it did do was it encouraged me to go and talk to women and that was like my
1:01:45
gateway drug where I'm like "Oh my gosh people will respond to me if I act nice and interested." Sure yeah so Alando
1:01:50
Baton however you say his name he has really good information out there he has an episode of Dire of the CEO he's
1:01:56
basically this British guy philosopher who just has studied a lot of stuff yeah school of life guy he's amazing i
1:02:02
interviewed for him for my book he's really awesome um Esther Pel is one of the goats here and her book meeting in
1:02:08
captivity has changed a lot of people's lives really the godmother godfather of relationship science the scientific
1:02:14
study of all this stuff are John and Julie Gottman and they really set the bar for all of this information and so
1:02:21
much of the research that I and other people quote is really from them and they are really the people who created
1:02:27
this love lab they actually tested out a lot of this stuff and they really defined a lot of this obviously people
1:02:33
can read my book How to Not Die Alone and I also have um 12 coaches who work
1:02:39
for me who a lot of them specialize working specifically with men and Sam going back to what you said earlier it's
1:02:46
actually pretty easy for a lot of them to coach men because they are not doing some of the basic things and when they
1:02:52
get these guys just doing the basic things that make a difference they start seeing success so quickly i'm actually
1:02:57
reading one of John Gottman's books now um he I think he's the man i think seven
1:03:03
things seven principles to make a marriage work i think that like Yeah yeah that's like the classic amazing one to me like reading some of these books
1:03:10
like I'll tell people I'm reading them i'm like "Oh do you have a problem with your marriage?" I'm like "No it's pretty great it's just that like you don't want
1:03:15
to wait until you're sick to start exercising." Like it's it's kind of like good to like to do maintenance or like
1:03:21
to do couples therapy if you're like "Oh you guys are on the fritz." It's like "No it's like I'm pretty fit and I still go to the gym all the time." You want to
Mental Health vs Mental Fitness
1:03:27
like maintain and keep things nice otherwise when they do get bad you're like "Ah shoot." I think one of the the
1:03:32
big edges in life right now is uh people think that if you let's say you do
1:03:38
therapy or you're doing any kind of like mental health it's like it's literally the word mental health is you know
1:03:44
basically implies some sort of sickness right like why would you do that is something wrong is something broken and
1:03:50
it hasn't shifted yet to something more like mental fitness where you know people who go to crossfit you don't
1:03:56
accuse you know you don't look at them and be like oh it's because you're diseased and sick right it's like no no these people just they actually care
1:04:01
about maximizing where they're what they could do physically and so similarly I think in terms of um your mindset being
1:04:07
as clear as you could be being as um positive as you could be being as having a positive outlook on your own life and
1:04:13
actually taking the time to do that is really important and same thing with relationships there's an assumption that if you're working on a new relationship
1:04:18
it's cuz it's hurting or broken i think that's just like insane there's like a relationship fitness that that's very
1:04:24
different than you know just relationship health as in you're you're sort of nursing back from some problem
1:04:30
sean I'll add on to that and say I actually think we're halfway there in terms of the shift so the language that we used to use would be mental illness
1:04:36
now we say mental health right and then I think going towards what you said mental fitness makes so much sense yeah
1:04:43
it's a lot better than saying you're just you're just you're off your rocket right but my friend Emily had a book that just came out about being
1:04:49
emotionally fit and it's basically like yeah how can you go to the gym for your fitness and it's not like oh I worked
1:04:54
out arms yesterday i'm good for life it's like you have to constantly work at it and that's actually the crux of what
1:05:00
the Gins say and my favorite takeaway from their many years of research is this idea that relationships are not
1:05:07
about the honeymoon or the trip to Hawaii they're about the daily life
1:05:13
interactions and so they talk about this concept of a bid so a bid could be something really small it could be that
1:05:19
Sam walks into the room where Sarah's on her laptop and she size and that's a bid from Sarah for Sam to say "Oh no what's
1:05:26
going on?" And Sam can do one of three things he can turn towards her and say "What's happening?" He can turn away
1:05:33
from her or ignore it or he can turn against her and be like "Why are you making so much sound you know I'm on an
1:05:39
important phone call." And so life is really about these interactions and so successful couples that have happy long
1:05:45
marriages they turn towards each other 86% of the time and the the couples that
1:05:51
break up or are the relationship disasters they only turn towards each other 33% of the time so it's really
1:05:58
about in these small moments how you turn towards your partner we should actually Sean do an episode on this John
1:06:04
Gottman guy he's kind of crazy like he he's he's elderly now but he like has
1:06:09
done this for probably 50 years and he's been doing well yeah but you know he's been doing it forever but there's some
1:06:16
crazy stats where like he uh he could predict within 90 or he could do it 90%
1:06:22
of the time he could predict if you're going to get divorced or not i think within like three minutes or something yeah something like insane you know he
1:06:28
was like the Yeah for people who haven't checked out you should uh should go look it up he's got this thing called love lab and he would have couples come in
1:06:33
and essentially argue or fight and he would observe them and they would mark on a score sheet like every like every
1:06:40
second there was an inter like some some mark of like what the interaction was doing and they had this like sort of scoring system and basically they could
1:06:46
score a couple's interactions in just a couple of minutes and predict with a 90% accuracy like what the whether that
1:06:53
couple's going to s sort of stay together or end up uh you know breaking apart which is which is kind of amazing
1:06:58
when you think about it and It it really shows you like life is in the micro it's
1:07:03
not the it's not the macro like we think I think you were talking about this with dating right like oh I have a type and I
1:07:08
have this idea of how we're going to meet or I have a soulmate i have the one and it's like all these like macro language when like a huge amount of life
1:07:16
is just in the micro it's like oh yeah she you know she said she was training for um you know an Iron Man or something
1:07:22
like that and then I just said oh me too i did well and instead of like asking her about it I pulled it to I pulled the
1:07:28
conversation to me instead of like leaning into what she was saying and that it's like the micro is the difference between a great date and an
1:07:34
okay date and then and then how you think about it afterwards right like each one of those is just like a bunch
1:07:39
of micro decisions that lead to your actual result sean this is I feel like your superpower i feel like you're kind
1:07:46
of like what I say like 10 minutes worth of stuff and then you just summarize the stuff that's worth the takeaway it's
1:07:51
kind of like your chatb just being like "Here's what she really meant." So I really appreciate that and there's a
1:07:57
good term for what you're talking about which is a shift versus support response i think a lot of people especially men
1:08:03
get this wrong so let's say a woman says "Oh I'm going to Lake Tahoe this summer." The guy's like "Cool i'm going
1:08:09
to seem interested." And add on to that by saying "I went to Lake Tahoe last summer." That's actually shifting the
1:08:14
energy back towards yourself what women and people in general like is when you help them go deeper and you say "How did
1:08:20
you choose Lake Tahoe have you ever been there before what are you most looking forward to have you ever traveled with your family before?" Support responses
1:08:28
help that person go deeper and so you might think that they're equal but people actually appreciate the support responses more because it shows
1:08:35
curiosity about the other person and it makes them feel interesting oh yeah by the way Logan what's your deal so you
1:08:41
got a Netflix show you wrote a book it did great you're doing stuff at Hinge
1:08:47
you're on this podcast like you're kind of a a superstar in the making here what's or maybe you already are and I'm late to the party but like what's your
1:08:53
what's your deal are you trying to be like the love guru what's what are you trying to do i mean I feel pretty happy
1:08:59
right now it's like I made a vision board about seven years ago so I was how I met Sam's wife is that we worked
1:09:06
together Airbnb we didn't even overlap that long and I was just like I really have this passion for dating and
1:09:11
relationships everything's telling me that there's an opportunity here people are lost and I can help them and so I
1:09:16
quit my job not knowing what I would do and I've sort of just from scratch created this career and it's taken the form of a newsletter a book The Job at
1:09:25
Hinge the Netflix show i am hopefully going to have my own podcast this year
1:09:31
and so I'm just kind of like how can I keep learning and how can I keep helping people find love but I don't feel like
1:09:38
there's like a next level that I need to get to i kind of just want to enjoy where I am right now and what's your uh
1:09:44
do you feel a lot of pressure cuz let's say you're a relationship coach the the stupid like kind of layman
1:09:52
version of me is just like "So do they have it all figured out?" Like and I know that's never the case but like I
1:09:58
think there is like this weird expectation that people have especially the further you are away from doing the work yourself that if you're talking
1:10:04
about this that means you need to be like fully self-actualized in some way and so do do you feel pressure in that
1:10:09
and like I guess like I guess like what's your I don't know when did you when did you get married how how did that go for you i'm just curious sure
1:10:16
yeah so I will quote one of my mentors here so Eli Finkele is one of the best relationship scientists in the country and he's at Northwestern and the
1:10:24
dedication in his book is to my wife Allison who thinks it's hilarious that I'm a marriage expert and so I kind of I
1:10:31
kind of feel the same way but what I will say is basically the thing that fascinates me the most the thing that I
1:10:36
feel like I always want to work on is the decision-making process of who do you marry so I actually feel like I'm more of a dating expert than a marriage
1:10:42
expert so sometimes when people ask me about sex I'm like I don't know [ __ ] about sex i'm not a sex expert what I'm
1:10:48
actually really good at is who you should be with and why and so I don't feel as much pressure as someone who's
1:10:54
putting out there a book about marriage but I would say like of course I have my own issues and of course there's moments
1:11:00
where I'm like oh my husband's pretty introverted my life would be easier if he wanted to go to this party with me
1:11:05
and then I just remind myself like here's all the things that are great about him and I also say to myself here's all the annoying things that are
1:11:11
annoying about me and by kind of like negging myself it also helps me be more understanding of my husband one last
1:11:18
thing I'll say about that is that I think having a kid has changed our relationship so much more so much for
1:11:24
the positive because in the past if he did something that annoyed me I might either say something about it or bubble
1:11:31
it up and then it explodes later but because I see what a great dad he is my tank is so full with love for him that I
1:11:38
can just let most things go and that has been a really good development sean her husband's hilarious and and if I say
1:11:44
anything that is too much we can take this out but basically he uh he's a vegan like hardcore vegan but he's
1:11:51
shredded and you're like why do And he'll tell you he's going for the hungry wolf or hungry lion aesthetic hungry
1:11:57
warrior so he like looks hungry but he's like trying to get after it in life he's shredded and he uh he he's an engineer
1:12:04
he works at a big AI company where he's like brilliant and also he lost his leg
1:12:09
recently because of cancer a couple years ago but he like laughs about it and he's just like a very principled
1:12:15
very interesting almost strange guy in the best way like he doesn't have any social media everything about him you're
1:12:21
like that's strange and then you start hearing his reasoning and you're like oh you're you're you live the right way i'm
1:12:27
the flawed one uh it's like it's a very funny he's a very funny guy yeah i think that's a beautiful testament to my
1:12:33
husband and I think that I'm drawn to very extreme people i I think that's one of the reasons why I love Sam i love My
1:12:40
First Million i I think it kind of goes back to this thing of like you can create the life that you want you can
1:12:45
create your own rules you can live that way and I've never met anyone more than my husband who doesn't care what other
1:12:50
people think and so it is hard to be this hardcore vegan we went to this wedding and there was basically no food
1:12:56
for him to eat well guess what he brings packets of Justin's peanut butter and he chugs them in the bathroom and he
1:13:01
pregames with sweet grains like he just basically adapts and I think he's very extreme like yeah his he's super healthy
1:13:08
he works out every day he meditates every day he lost his leg to cancer but a few weeks from now he's going to be
1:13:13
climbing in the paracclimbing World Cup championship and so he's just an extreme
1:13:19
guy who's very disciplined and has been very successful oh and he's really funny
1:13:26
amazing logan this was great uh to all you singles out there you're welcome you're welcome for the advice you're
1:13:32
welcome for the uh the tips go take some photos get some good lighting um by the way what's a good first date spot so
1:13:38
somebody goes somebody wants to do a first date with somebody they meet on an app should they be doing coffee dinner
1:13:43
what's the move dinner's too intense i think coffee feels too much like a job interview what if you go get an
1:13:50
interesting maybe non-alcoholic drink somewhere and go for a walk i think people have really great conversations when they don't have to make this direct
1:13:56
eye contact or just go go do something fun go play pickle ball and kind of shake out your sillies and you know take
1:14:03
yourself a little less seriously all right thank you so much Logan great to have you thanks a lot see you thank
1:14:09
you [Music]
